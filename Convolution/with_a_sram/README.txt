--How to Execute Verilog Simulation
In this directory, you can enter the following 3 commands to execute 3 kinds of simulation:
1. $ make a
   It will generate the waveform file " hw03a.fsdb " in this directory
2. $ make b
   It will generate the waveform file " hw03b.fsdb " in this directory
3. $ make c
   It will generate the waveform file " hw03c.fsdb " in this directory

All of above commands also generate some text files for execution.



--How to Execute Simulation with Post-synthesis Verilog File
In this directory, you can enter the following 3 commands to execute 3 kinds of simulation:
1. $ make a_syn
   It will generate the waveform file " hw03a_syn.fsdb " in this directory
2. $ make b_syn
   It will generate the waveform file " hw03b_syn.fsdb " in this directory
3. $ make c_syn
   It will generate the waveform file " hw03c_syn.fsdb " in this directory

All of above commands also generate some text files for execution.
